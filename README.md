#https Switcher Ribbon#

##Pinciple##
With this code into a page, or a site, when people visite the site using http protocol instead of https, the ribbon is visible and the link is a rewriting of the current URL (replacement of http by https).

##Customization##
If customization is needed, you can use [css-fork-on-github-ribbon/](https://codepo8.github.io/css-fork-on-github-ribbon/) which permit to 

- change color,
- size,
- shadow,
- alignment,
- vertical position.

And also which is the source of this fork dev.

After that, you can copy the style, but be careful I renamed the id **forkongithub** to **activessl**, so don't forget to change that in the new style.
